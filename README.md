# Pivot

A VS Code extension that allows you to take point-in-time snapshots of your workspace, so you can pivot to other tasks and restore your previous state later.

## What it does

Pivot captures the current state of your VS Code workspace, including:

- All open files and tabs

This is perfect for when you need to switch contexts but want to return to exactly where you left off.
